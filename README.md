2. Import in your `index.tsx` via `import 'scrivito-i18n-plugin';`

## How to use

2. There should be a dialog opening
![Plugin Dialog](./static/plugin.png?raw=true)

Here you can see an overview of all your different sites, their siteIds and paths. From there on, you can select a root site and copy it and all its children to a new siteId, where it can be used via the Scrivito Multisite feature.
